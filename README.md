# Corundum
A live programming environment for Ruby.

## Description

Corundum aspires to be a live programming environment for the Ruby programming language. It is inspired by the [Pharo IDE](https://pharo.org/web) which is in turn derived from the Smalltalk programming language. Corundum should allow live inspection, debugging, and editing of Ruby code. Corundum should be able to fully explore source from the Ruby standard library and any installed Gems. Ruby in turn can be used to extend and modify Corundum and instantly see results. Corundum can be thought of to Ruby what Emacs is to Lisp.

## About the Name

Excerpt from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum):

> Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium. It is a rock-forming mineral. Corundum has two primary gem varieties: ruby and sapphire. Rubies are red due to the presence of chromium, and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present. 
>
> The name "corundum" is derived from the Tamil-Dravidian word kurundam (ruby-sapphire) (appearing in Sanskrit as kuruvinda).
